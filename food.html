        <i><b>Indian cuisine</b></i> consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.
        Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially
        and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by
        religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions. Centuries of Islamic rule, particularly by
        the Mughals, also introduced dishes like samosa and pilaf.

        Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain
        foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to
        India. A number of these such as the potato, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and Guava have become staples in many
        regions of India. Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between
        India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and
        traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those
        from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America,
        Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.
